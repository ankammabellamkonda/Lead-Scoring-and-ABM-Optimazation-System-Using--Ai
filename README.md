============================================================
              Lead Scoring Case Study Project
                Infosys Springboard Internship
============================================================

1. Project Overview
--------------------
The Lead Scoring Case Study project leverages logistic regression to predict and rank leads for an education company (X Education) that markets online courses. By assigning each lead a score between 0 and 100, the model helps the sales team prioritize high-potential leads—ultimately aiming to improve conversion rates.

2. Problem Statement
--------------------
X Education attracts numerous professionals to its website through various online channels (e.g., Google search, referrals, social media). When visitors provide their contact details (via forms or video views), they become “leads.” However, only a fraction of these leads eventually convert into customers. The project’s goal is to identify the factors influencing lead conversion and build a predictive model that scores leads, so that the sales team can focus their efforts on “hot leads.”

3. Objectives
-------------
- **Analyze Lead Data:** Investigate historical data to uncover key factors influencing conversion.
- **Develop Predictive Model:** Build and tune a logistic regression model to generate a lead score (0–100).
- **Improve Sales Efficiency:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations to help prioritize leads.
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Ensure that the approach can be adjusted for future business requirements.

4. Dataset Description
----------------------
The dataset includes records of leads with various attributes such as:
  - **Demographic Details:** Age, location, professional background.
  - **Behavioral Metrics:** Website browsing patterns, form submissions, video interactions.
  - **Lead Source:** Origin of the lead (e.g., search engines, referrals).
  - **Conversion Status:** Indicator of whether a lead eventually converted.

5. Methodology & Approach
--------------------------
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

  a. **Data Preprocessing:**
     - Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers).
     - Feature encoding and normalization.
  
  b. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
     - Visualizations and statistical summaries to identify trends and correlations.
  
  c. **Model Development:**
     - Split data into training and testing sets.
     - Build a logistic regression model to estimate conversion probability.
     - Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning.
  
  d. **Model Evaluation:**
     - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
  
  e. **Insights & Recommendations:**
     - Interpret model coefficients to understand key drivers.
     - Provide recommendations for targeted sales strategies.

6. Technologies & Tools Used
-----------------------------
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

7. How to Run the Project
--------------------------
a. **Installation:**
   1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
   2. Install required libraries via pip:
      ```
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
      ```
b. **Execution:**
   1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file: 
      `lead_scoring_case_study_using_logistic_regression.ipynb`
   2. Run all notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
   3. Review the outputs and visualizations to understand model performance and insights.

8. Results & Insights
----------------------
- The logistic regression model successfully assigns a score to each lead.
- Analysis revealed that factors such as lead source and user behavior significantly influence conversion probability.
- The model’s performance metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, precision, recall) indicate strong predictive ability.
- Recommendations include focusing on leads with high scores and continuously updating the model as new data becomes available.

9. Future Work
--------------
- **Model Enhancement:** Incorporate additional machine learning techniques (e.g., ensemble methods) to further boost performance.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Develop a mechanism for regular model retraining to adapt to market changes.
- **Broader Data Integration:** Explore integration of external data sources (e.g., social media signals) for improved lead insights.
